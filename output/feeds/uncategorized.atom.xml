&lt;p&gt;As you have noticed, I have changed the theme giving the blog a more
professional look. I also have decided to write in english, so more
people will be able to read the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, is quite important in the technology world. English is also
my favorite language, so in this way I will practice it more to get
better.&lt;/p&gt;
