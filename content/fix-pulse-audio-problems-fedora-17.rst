With this release, I have been having some pulse audio problems.
Sometimes I do not have sound while playing Â Spotify, Rhythmbox or any
other desktop player.

After a research, it is usually fixed with this three lines (not
always):

::

    rm -rf ~/.pulse
    pulseaudio --kill
    pulseaudio -vvvvv

Do not run it as root.
